# Statistics

Here we write Ω for the sample space of all possible outcomes of an experiment. Ω can be a set
containing anything (numbers, objects, colours etc.). An event is a subset of Ω. A probability
measure is a real-valued function Pr defined on 2Ω (this is a power set, the set of all subsets of
Ω), satisfying the following axioms


$$
  \int_0^\infty \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}\,dx = \frac{\pi^4}{15}
$$ (label3)
