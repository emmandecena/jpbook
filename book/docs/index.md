# Welcome

Hello! I'm Emmanuel, a Philippine-based **R/Python developer** and **data scientist** specializing in energy markets and related industries. I provide end-to-end solutions for data analytics teams - from finding opportunities for product and process optimization, to deployment of data-driven applications to serve end users.

## Background and experience

My technical background comes from over six (6) years of experience and advanced training in the energy industry: from electricity market trading and dispatch operations of thermal power plants to electrical systems design of gas processing plants. I obtained my postgraduate degree in energy from the University of Auckland, under full scholarship. See my <a href="https://www.ecdecena.com/resume-emmanuel-decena.pdf" target="_blank">**resume**</a> for more details.
