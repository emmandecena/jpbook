# Welcome

This site is a collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrating various data science and machine learning use cases across the energy and related industries, compiled by [Emmanuel Decena](about/contact).

Here are some of the features of this site:

**Case studies on various datasets** ✍
^^^
Notebooks currently focused on energy and electricity markets such as: [Exploratory Data Analysis on Energy Market datasets](datasets/philenergy), [Geocoding of Market Participants using Google API](electricitymarkets/energymarket) , [Forecasting of Regional Electricity Demand](electricitymarkets/demand), and [Forecasting of Market Clearing Prices](electricitymarkets/clearingprice). 
---
**Algorithms for optimization** 🚀
^^^
Demonstrate various optimization methods using Python and Julia such as: Linear Programming, Heuristic Methods, Decision Analysis, and Dynamic Programming. 
---
**Statistical learning techniques** ✨
^^^
Supervised and Unsupervised techniques such as Time Series Clustering, Dimension reduction using SVM.
---
**Foundations on mathematics** 💡
^^^
Definitions and key theorems in [Linear Algebra](math/linalg), [Probability Theory](math/prob), [Computational Statistics](math/rstat), and [Operations Research](math/or) as the foundations for machine learning methods.
```

The notebooks are organized into a three major groups according to their content:

- **Data Exploration** demonstrate step-by-step data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization procedures.
- **Model Development** cover specific machine learning algorithms in more depth to produce a working model.
- **Reference** notebooks provide a review behind the theory and industry-specific knowledge.

Here are some featured notebooks.
