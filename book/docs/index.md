**[Foundations on mathematics](#)** 💡
^^^
Definitions and key theorems in [Linear Algebra](math/linalg), Probability Theory, Statistics, and Operations Research as the foundations for machine learning methods.
```

The notebooks are organized into a three major groups according to their content:

- **Data Exploration** demonstrate step-by-step data cleaning, wrangling, and visualization procedures.
- **Model Development** cover specific machine learning algorithms in more depth to produce a working model.
- **Reference** notebooks provide a review behind the theory and industry-specific knowledge.
