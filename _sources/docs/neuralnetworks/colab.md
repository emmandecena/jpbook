# Using Colab

Due to local machine limitations, I use Google Colab to run the analysis when training artificial neural networks with large datasets. 

Google Colab provides access to GPUs and TPUs which can greatly reduce the training time for ANNs.

Some of the links below open to Colab-run notebooks which have been converted to html for rendering on this site.
